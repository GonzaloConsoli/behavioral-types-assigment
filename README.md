# Behavioral types assignment

## Building & running

`run.sh` will build and typecheck both clients and the server, and it'll also run a simple interaction within them. The interaction consists of starting the server and running both clients sequentially, both of them will attempt to fetch the file `example`.

> This script assumes the JaTyC repo has been cloned into `$HOME/java-typestate-checker`, if that's not the case you must specify the correct path via the `JATYC_PATH` variable used in the script.
